# R and Python: 2 Worlds Collide

I realize that the title and subtitle for this page may make it seem like we are gonna do something insanely cool, but it will just be a quick demonstration with some simple reticulate shenanigans.


Let's start with our first component: R. Below you'll see me load up the reticulate package and save a variable as "Da".

```{r}
library(reticulate)
Da<-"LESSS"
```

Now for our second component: Python. Now using Python, we'll put these two languages together to make a meme.
```{python}
Baby="GO"
print(r.Da,Baby)
```

I apologize for the short blog demonstration, but today has been a crazy day trying to finish up all my final assignments for tonight. Resident Evil 8 launches at midnight, and I want to play through the game deadline-free!

Hope you enjoyed the little meme, and Dr. Woodward, thank you for making my final semester an interesting one in your class. You're awesome!
